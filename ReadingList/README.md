## How to Add New Papers

1. Build a new directory with your name (in the format like HuangKaixin) in current directory.
2. Copy the Huangkaixin/hkx-template.md to your directory and rename it (in the format like hkx.md).
3. Follow the rules shown in hkx-template.md (while you can refer to hkx.md) and complete the week report. Notice that you should add at least two papers every week.

2. Read at least one paper very carefully and the other/another with less engery.
3. Everyone should get ready to report one paper once a month, including PhD Candidates, Master Candidates and Ready-to-graduate students.
