## How to Add Papers

1. Create a directory named with conference/journal (like FAST/TC) of the paper (if there doesn't exist one).
2. Name the paper in the format: shortTitle-year-school.pdf.
3. Move the paper you read to that directory.

## NOTICE

1. Only add the paper after you have read it.
2. Make sure there is a week report including this paper inside your own week-report directory (e.g., ReadingList/Huangkaixin/hkx.md)
